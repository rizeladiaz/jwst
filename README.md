**JWST requires Python 3.6 or above and a C compiler for dependencies**.

Installation
------------

The ``jwst`` package can be installed into a virtualenv or conda environment via ``pip``.  We recommend creating a fresh environment with only python installed.  Via conda:

    conda create -n jwst_env python=3.7
    conda activate jwst_env

### Installing for end-users ###

To install a released (tagged) version, you can install directly from Github.  To install tagged release ``jwst 0.14.2``:

    pip install git+https://github.com/spacetelescope/jwst@0.14.2

The latest development version (from ``master``) can also be installed from Github:

    pip install git+https://github.com/spacetelescope/jwst

As can a particular commit hash:

    pip install git+https://github.com/spacetelescope/jwst@3f03323c

### Installing a DMS release ###

We still package our releases to DMS via environment snapshots that specify the exact versions of all packages to be installed.

The latest release 0.14.2 may be installed in two stages by running the following commands:

Stage 1:

    conda create -n jwstdp-0.14.2 --file https://ssb.stsci.edu/releases/jwstdp/0.14.2/[env_file]
    source activate jwstdp-0.14.2

Where `[env_file]` = `conda_python_stable-deps.txt` for Linux
and   `[env_file]` = `conda_python_macos-stable-deps.txt` for Macos

Stage 2:

    pip install -r https://ssb.stsci.edu/releases/jwstdp/0.14.2/[pkgs_file]

Where `[pkgs_file]` = `reqs_stable-deps.txt` for Linux
and   `[pkgs_file]` = `reqs_macos-stable-deps.txt` for Macos

Each such delivery has its own installation instructions which may be found in
the corresponding release documentation linked from this page: https://github.com/astroconda/astroconda-releases/tree/master/jwstdp

The version values shown there are the JWSTDP releases available to install.
Installation procedures for each version are in the README.md file for that
version. See the "Software vs DMS build version map" table below for a
list of version tags corresponding to particular releases.

The installation procedures may change from time to time, so consulting the
documentation page for the specific version in question is the best way to get
that version installed.

### Installing for developers ###

Fork and clone the repo:

    git clone https://github.com/spacetelescope/jwst
    cd jwst

*Note: `python setup.py install` and `python setup.py develop` commands do not work.*

Install from your local checked out copy as an "editable" install:

    pip install -e .

If you want to run the tests and/or build the docs, you can make sure those dependencies are installed too:

    pip install -e .[test]
    pip install -e .[docs]
    pip install -e .[test,docs]
    
Note: If you wish to install directly from github, but also include the extra dependencies, the syntax is as follows:

    pip install "jwst[test] @ git+https://github.com/spacetelescope/jwst"

Need other useful packages in your development environment?

    pip install ipython flake8 pytest-xdist

### CRDS Setup ###

Inside the STScI network, the pipeline works with default CRDS setup with no modifications.  To run the pipeline outside the STScI network, CRDS must be configured by setting two environment variables:

    export CRDS_PATH=$HOME/crds_cache
    export CRDS_SERVER_URL=https://jwst-crds.stsci.edu


Documentation
-------------

Documentation (built daily from `master`) is available at:

https://jwst-pipeline.readthedocs.io/en/latest/

To build the docs yourself, clone this repository and build the documentation with:

    pip install -e .[docs]
    cd docs
    make html
    make latexpdf

Note: CRDS_CONTEXT values flagged with an asterisk in the above table are estimates
(formal CONTEXT deliveries are only provided with final builds).

Unit Tests
----------

Unit tests can be run via `pytest`.  Within the top level of your local `jwst` repo checkout:

    pip install -e .[test]
    pytest

Need to parallelize your test runs over 8 cores?

    pip install pytest-xdist
    pytest -n 8


Regression Tests
----------------

Latest regression test results can be found here (STScI staff only):

https://plwishmaster.stsci.edu:8081/job/RT/job/JWST/

The test builds start at 6pm local Baltimore time Monday through Saturday on `jwcalibdev`.

To run the regression tests on your local machine, get the test dependencies and set the environment variable TEST_BIGDATA to our Artifactory server (STSci staff members only)

    pip install -e .[test]
    export TEST_BIGDATA=https://bytesalad.stsci.edu/artifactory

To run all the regression tests:

    pytest --bigdata jwst/regtest

You can control where the test results are written with the `--basetemp=<PATH>` arg to `pytest`.  _Note that `pytest` will wipe this directory clean for each test session, so make sure it is a scratch area._

If you would like to run a specific test, find its name or ID and use the `-k` option:

    pytest --bigdata --basetemp=<PATH> jwst/regtest -k wcs

If developers need to update the truth files in our nightly regression tests, there are instructions in the repository wiki.
