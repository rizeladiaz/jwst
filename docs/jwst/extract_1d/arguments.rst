Step Arguments
==============

The extract_1d step has five step-specific arguments.

``--smoothing_length``
  If ``smoothing_length`` is greater than 1 (and is an odd integer), the
  background will be smoothed in the dispersion direction with a boxcar of
  this width.  If ``smoothing_length`` is None (the default), the step will
  attempt to read the value from the reference file.  If a value was
  specified in the reference file, that will be used.  Note that in this
  case a different value can be specified for each slit.  If no value was
  specified either by the user or in the reference file, no background
  smoothing will be done.

``--bkg_order``
  This is the order of a polynomial function to be fit to the background
  regions.  The fit is done independently for each column (or row, if the
  dispersion is vertical) of the input image, and the fitted curve will be
  subtracted from the target data.  ``bkg_order`` = 0 (the minimum allowed
  value) means to fit a constant.  The user-supplied value (if any)
  overrides the value in the reference file.  If neither is specified, a
  value of 0 will be used.

``--log_increment``
  Most log messages are suppressed while looping over integrations, i.e. when
  the input is a CubeModel or a 3-D SlitModel.  Messages will be logged while
  processing the first integration, but since they would be the same for
  every integration, most messages will only be written once.  However, since
  there can be hundreds or thousands of integrations, which can take a long
  time to process, it would be useful to log a message every now and then to
  let the user know that the step is still running.

  ``log_increment`` is an integer, with default value 50.  If it is greater
  than 0, an INFO message will be printed every ``log_increment``
  integrations, e.g. "... 150 integrations done".

``--subtract_background``
  This is a boolean flag to specify whether the background should be
  subtracted.  If None, the value in the extract_1d reference file (if any)
  will be used.  If not None, this parameter overrides the value in the
  extract_1d reference file.

``--apply_nod_offset``
  This is a boolean flag to specify whether the target and background positions
  specified in the reference file should be shifted to account for nod
  and/or dither offset.  If None (the default), the value in the reference
  file will be used, or it will be set to True if it is not specified in
  the reference file.  The offset is determined by finding the location in
  the data corresponding to the target position (as given by keywords
  TARG_RA and TARG_DEC).

  At the time of writing, a nod/dither offset will not be applied if the
  source is extended.  It will also not be applied for wide-field slitless
  spectroscopy data, or NIRSpec fixed-slit, or NIRSpec MOS (MSA) data.
